Completed exercises from The Elements of Computing Systems book by Nisan and Schocken. The website associated with the book can be found [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). Files written by me have file names that are prefixed with "RPD_". The rest of the files were downloaded from the course website and are mostly used for testing whether the exercises have been completed correctly.
